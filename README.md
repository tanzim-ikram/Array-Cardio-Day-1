## Overview
This project is a JavaScript exercise focused on practicing array methods such as:
- `filter()`
- `map()`

It includes a dataset of famous inventors and a list of people, providing various tasks to manipulate and analyze the data using JavaScript array methods.

## Features

- **Map**: Retrieve full names of inventors.
- **Sort**: Order inventors by birthdate.
- **Reduce**: Calculate the total years all inventors lived.
- **Sort by Years Lived**: Rank inventors by their lifespan.
- **Sort People Alphabetically**: Organize names by last name.
- **Reduce Data Occurrences**: Count instances of different transport modes.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Open the Developer Console (`F12` > Console) to view the output.
3. Observe results from various array manipulations.
